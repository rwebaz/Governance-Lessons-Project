## Duty To Help Mitigate

The State of Massachusetts Supreme Court just ruled a failure to provide a "Reasonable Accommodation" to a handicapped employee is a violation of the law.

**Rule**. A company has a duty to help mitigate an employee's reasonable request for accommodation.

And, barring no other "Reasonable Accommodation" discovered, the employer must reasonably accommodate the employee's request.

## Medicine or No Medicine

The bottom line ( in Massachusetts ) is the answer to the age old question of whether or not #Medmj is indeed medicine.

The Supreme Court of the State of Massachusetts has determined it is ...!

And, therefore, #Medmj should be treated as a "Reasonable Accommodation" by an employer as an employee would consider a request to accommodate any other prescription medicine.

## Is the Patient Handicapped

If a #Medmj patient asserts the lack of a full ability to perform ANY life function, such as sleeping, or eating, or elimination, or even the full ability to hold down a job ...

Then, that patient is considered to be "Handicapped" under the law.

## Conclusion

A handicapped patient in Massachusetts is eligible for protection from termination of employment under the law after submitting to a failed company mandated marijuana drug test.
