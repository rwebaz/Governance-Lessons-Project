## Trump Dump

"Posterity will execrate your memory if the United States reverts to a tyrannic aristocracy or subversive despotism." ~ Robert Yates of New York aka Brutus, Essay I

The Baron de Montesquieu warned us of electing a sovereign hell bent on raising himself ( or, herself ) to grandeur on the ruins of his ( or, her ) country.

In the United States, we citizens have now experienced and have endured TWO such Presidents in this 21st century.

## Both GOP's.

One was undoubtedly George W Bush, Jr., and the other of course is this current clown in the White House, Donald John Trump.

If the Muslim religion is the root of all terrorism, then surely this condemnable party is the root of all government malaise in this country.

Which is why I left the GOP party, and so should you.

## Indirect Representation

Elected representatives, whether be State of Federal, are chosen and empowered by the people to know the minds of their constituents, and then to be possessed of sufficient levels of integrity to declare this mind.

However, the operations of government may also become retarted thus preventing conclusions that will promote the public good.

How so?

Via the constant clashing of opinions with representatives on one aisle who are continually striving against those of the other aisle.

The net result?

Gridlock.

A real swamp!

The government will then becomes nerveless and inefficient, and will be forced to establish an armed force necessary to execute the laws of the land at the point of a bayonet.

Thus proving the defect in fundamental principles adhered upon which a free and equal government must rest.
